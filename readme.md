*A simple implementation of the Huffman Encoding written in Node Js.*

**Usage:**
npm install 
node my_huff.js 


The program search in the standard printable ASCII for a character not used 
in the input text to be used as EOF, therefore it will terminate without 
encoding if a text that uses all ASCII chars is given as input. 

To test with different files, comment/uncomment the "fileName" variables
starting from line 224.
